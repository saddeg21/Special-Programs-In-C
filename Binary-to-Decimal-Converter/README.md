# BINARY TO DECIMAL CONVERTER
To convert a binary number to a decimal number, we should know how does number systems work.
- Binary numbers are represented by 0 and 1
- Decimal numbers are represented by the numbers of interval of [0-9]

__WEIGHT__: Every digit has its own value and it increases as it goes from right to left. For binary every digit depends on exponentials of two and for decimals its exponentials of ten.
Lest significant bit is always weight 2^0=1 and for binary it goes like 2^1=2, 2^2=4 so on.
