# PERFECT NUMBERS
If a number is perfect, it means that sum of dividers of a number excluding the numbers itself is equal to that number.
For checking that :
-First find the dividers of number. For that create a loop and check if the __number_MOD_i__ is equal to 0. If it is, then it's a divider.
-If there's is a divider, add that number to sum variable that we've declared at the starting.
