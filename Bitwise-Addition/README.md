# BITWISE ADDITION
Computer do arithmetical operations by using logic circuits. For the addition, it could use __HALF ADDER__.
For that it makes:
- Take a and b and for the sum variable, it make XOR Operation
- For the carry variable, it make AND Operation
- Assign a to sum and assing b to carry
- Loops until b=0

__CARRY__ : It's there for carrying the result of a 1&1 operation. Because its result is 10 so more bits than it took.
__SUM__: Sum is like a normal XOR operation.

__IF CARRY IS 0, THEN IT MEANS THAT ARITHMETICAL OPERATION ENDED UP WELL__
