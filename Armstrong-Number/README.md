# ARMSTRONG NUMBER
Armstrong number is a special type of number. In terms of Math, we say order of a number is how much digit it consist of.
Armstrong number suggest that if exponent is equal to order, and if we take exponentiation of every digits value one by one according to that exponent and sum them,
then the result is equal to numbers itself.

For example:
371 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1
