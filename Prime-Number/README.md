# PRIME NUMBER
A number greater than 1 is called as __prime number__, if it has only two factors, namely 1 and the numbers itself.

If a number has more than two factors, than it is called as __COMPOSITE NUMBER__

## WHY 1 Is Not Prime ? 
Because according to definition, it have to have two factors but 1 has only 1 factor. __1 IS NOT PRIME__

## How to Find If It Is A Prime Number?
We first need to calculate the __square root__ of prime number and then divide the prime numbers to numbers which is equal or less than square root of it. If it is divisible
to any of the number which is bigger than 1 and less or equal to square root, then it's not a prime number

For example we can find whether 23 is prime or not ?
-23's square root ise 4.7985 ~= 5
-Look if 23 is divided to numbers which is greater than 1 and less or equal to 5;

### FIND THE SQUARE ROOT OF NUMBER
C standard library has got a function called as __sqrt__ which gives the square root. If you give it an integer than it will convert it to double number.
__double sqrt(double x)__

Than there is another function called as __ceil__ and it will take a double number and return integer which is greater than or equal to given number.
__double ceil(double x)__
