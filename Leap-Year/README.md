# LEAP YEAR
If you want to check whether a year is leap year or not, first you should not what does it mean.
The world rotates around the sun and it takes 365 days and 6 hours. For a regular calendar, __GREGORIAN__ designed a system. In that system, at every 4 year we have a leap year and it's year which consist of 366 days. Others consist of 365 days as well.

If you want to check whether it's a leap year there are some problem like millenial years. For checking that we use a greatly structured if conditions.
- First things first, check whether it's divided by 400. If it is, then it's a leap year.
- Else check if it's divided by 100. If it is ,then it's NOT a leap year.
- If it doesn't divided by 100 or 400 either, check whether it's divided by 4. If it is,then it's a leap year.
- Else it's not a leap year.
